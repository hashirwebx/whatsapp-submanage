```

Not sure? → Click "Try Demo Mode"
Explore first, decide later
```

### Rule #4: Follow The Colors
```
Blue = Read this important info
Green = Success, keep going
Orange = Action needed, click the button
Red = Error, read the message
```

### Rule #5: Email Checker Is Your Friend
```
Type email → Wait 1 second → Get instant feedback
Green checkmark = Good to go!
